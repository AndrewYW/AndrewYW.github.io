    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Ascii Chess was a 2 person project completed for my Software Methodology class.The program implements a 2 player Chess game, drawing the board and taking inputs from the Eclipse terminal. The program correctly identifies
      all chess moves, including recognizing checks, checkmates, illegal moves, as well as stalemates.
    Additionally, the project required that we create a UML diagram for the object-oriented design, as well as properly adding Javadoc tags and files. We were also required to use Bitbucket to push
    our code for collaboration and submission.</p>

Design:
The program is handled entirely through the eclipse terminal. As such, we opted to parse strings with the Java Scanner, and then convert them into "move" objects to use throughout the program. The bulk of the code
lies within a Game class, which is called by the main Chess class. In the Game class, each Move object is used as the input in a state machine

Moves and parsing strings:
String inputs into the program follow the form "FileRank FileRank", where the first FileRank refers to the coordinates of the piece to be moved, and the second to the end coordinate. There are a few exceptions to this
format, namely:
- Resignation: One player will input "resign" instead of the FileRank input format.
- Draw: The player offering to draw will input a string of the format "FileRank FileRank draw?", after which the other player may agree ("draw") or continue playing, by inputting a regular FileRank string.
- Promotion: On the turn that a players' pawn is to be promoted, the string input can become "FileRank FileRank x", where x is the letter corresponding to promotion pieces (Knight = N, Rook = R, Bishop = B, Queen = Q).
If there is no indicated letter for promotion, then it is automatically assumed to be a queen. All other special moves, such as checks, checkmates, en passant, castling, are done automatically with the regular string format.

Player objects:
Each player object (black and white) contains fields for their color, an array of Pieces that they own, and a reference to the board object. Included methods fulfill various roles, including promotion, initializing
pieces, getting pieces by their integer ID number (the index value of the piece in the array). The most important aspect of the Player object is the method to generate
all possible moves for the players turn; this method returns an array of move objects to be used when checking to
see that a move is valid.

The Game class:
The Game class runs the chess program. At its core, it is a finite state machine comprised of a while loop with 6 nested if/else if statements to handle the 6 states basic states that the game is in: Checkmate, Stalemate, Draw, Resignation,
Check, and regular moves. Of the 6, the first 5 states all end the loop, printing various statements, while the last loops as each player's turn occurs. Other methods in this class are helper methods to check the state
of the game, as well as perform each move. The method that parses the string input into Move objects is also located in the Game class.


Pieces:
Pieces were implemented as an abstract class, featuring methods for various tasks such as checking the legality of moves, and proper positioning. The Piece class features only one abstract method -
validMoves, which generates a list of valid moves each piece can make and returns it in an array of Move objects.

Spaces and the Chessboard:
One of the major challenges of the project was to figure out how to implement the chessboard properly. The recommended solution given in class was to implement it as a 2d array of Space objects, as it was
both the intuitive and easy to implement. However, we decided to go about this in a different manner, which was to hold the spaces in a one dimensional array, assigning
