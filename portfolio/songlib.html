    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Song Library was the first project I completed in my Software Methodology course. It served as an introduction to some basic software concepts, such as UI, events, and design patterns.
    The goal was to create a small Java GUI that could do three functions:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>Display a list of songs by name, with the ability to select one song from the list. The list of songs is persistent across different sessions of running the program.</li>
      <li>Display the details of the selected song: name, artist, album, year.</li>
      <li>Add/Edit/Delete songs:
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Add: Add a new song to the list, requiring at least the name and artist. Duplicate name/artist combinations are not allowed.</li>
          <li>Edit: Change any of the fields of a selected song. Cannot conflict with duplicate name/artist combinations again.</li>
          <li>Delete: Delete any selected song.</li>
          <li>Every action will have a confirmation appear before making the final change.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Design Requirements</h5>
    The requirements of the assignment stipulated that the program design should be both intuitive - as in, one shouldn't need instructions to understand how to use it - and appropriate - the solution should
    not be overly complex for the tasks at hand.
  </div>
  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-half">
    <h5>UI</h5>
    The UI was designed entirely with JavaFX and Gluon Scene Builder tool. Uniformity in buttons and textfields was achieved through a gridpane placed on top of an anchorpane, to allow for resizeability.
    Rather than use popups, we chose to incorporate every aspect in the GUI into one screen (other than warnings and confirmations). Add and edit buttons are aligned with the text fields that are required for their functions.
    When a song is selected, it is displayed in the edit column, to signify that they are changeable.
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-half">
    <h5>Song Class</h5>
    The Song class is relatively simple, with fields for title, artist, album, and year. It implements the Comparable interface (used to alphabetize the song list), and contains set and get methods.
    The compareTo method override uses the String compareTo method to compare title and artist. It returns either 0, 1, or -1 depending on result, which is used later on to place Songs into the list by index value.
  </div>
  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-half">
    <h5>The Song List</h5>
    The song list was required to automatically alphabetize upon each new entry or edit, based on the song title, then artist. Since there cannot be duplicate title/artist entries, there is no need to sort by album or year.
    We chose to use a listview and observable ArrayList to display the song list rather than tableview to avoid adding the unnecessary manual alphabetize button at the top of the column. To constantly alphabetize, we used the Song class'
    compareTo method to find what the index value of a new entry is, and insert it into the list at that position. The arraylist will expand as necessary, and there is no need to use any sorting algorithm on the list itself.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="w3-row-padding w3-container">
  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-half">
    <h5>Song Details</h5>
    A selected song in the list will always display the details of the song in the appropriate text fields.
  </div>
  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-half">
    <h5>Lambda Expression usage</h5>
    Lambda expressions feature in the program in two occasions: Song list selection changes, and writing to file when the program is closed.
    The lambda expression for selection changes is rather simple. We set a listener for selection changes, and when a new song is selected, the showSongDetails method is called to update text fields.

  </div>

  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-third">
    <h5>Delete button</h5>
    The logic behind the delete button is fairly simple: get the index of the selected song, and remove it using the remove method inheristed from the List class. After removing the item, the method will select
    an adjacent song to display. There is a check to see if the song list is empty, to avoid any errors occurring from removing a non existent song.
  </div>
  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-third">
    <h5>Add button</h5>
    The add button turned out to be the most complex button to implement. To implement it, we used two helper methods in addition to the regular FXML controller method: one method to find the index of the
    new song to be added, and the other to use that index value to attempt to add the song to the list. Both methods return integer values to signify success/failure states.

    The findIndex method works using the compareTo method defined in the Song class. Using a for loop, it scans through the song list, comparing each list item to the temporary Song until it finds the right index value.
    If a song is already found, it will return -1. If it belongs in the list, either in between songs or at the end, it will return the index value.

    The second helper method takes a temporary Song object created from the text fields as input. It will call the findIndex method, as well as check to make sure that the input format is correct. Alerts will be
    given if necessary. After that, it will add the song to the list (after confirmation), and clear the text fields.
  </div>
  <div class="w3-margin-bottom w3-third">
    <h5>Edit button</h5>
    The edit button follows similar logic to the add button: it creates a temporary Song object from the edit text fields, and adds it to the list if it is a legal song. The only difference is that the selected song
    (which is the song being edited) will also be removed.
