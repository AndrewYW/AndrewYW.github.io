title: Song Library
---

<!--Background: Song Library was the first project I completed in my Software Methodology course. It served as an introduction to some basic software concepts, such as UI, events, and design patterns.
The goal was to create a small Java GUI that could do three functions:
  - Display a list of songs by name, with the ability to select one song from the list
  - Display the details of the selected song: name, artist, album, year.
  - Add/Edit/Delete songs:
    - Add: Add a new song to the list, requiring at least the name and artist. Duplicate name/artist combinations are not allowed.
    - Edit: Change any of the fields of a selected song. Cannot conflict with duplicate name/artist combinations again.
    - Delete: Delete any selected song.
    - Every action will have a confirmation appear before making the final change.

The list of songs is persistent across different sessions of running the program.

Technology used: Java, JavaFX, Eclipse IDE, Scene Builder layout tool
Concepts: Event-driven GUI programming, MVC design pattern
