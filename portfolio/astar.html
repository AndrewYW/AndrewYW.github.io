    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Graph based search algorithms are used extensively in grid or graph based games for pathfinding, such as the
    Civilization series. Certain search algorithms, such as Breadth First Search, are incredibly popular introductory
    algorithms that can have added layers of complexity for specific circumstances. In an environment where a square node
    graph (i.e: Each node has 8 neighbors) has movement costs associated with different terrains, the A* search family
    (BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm/Uniform Cost Search, A*) generally is used more than other search algorithms.</p>

    <p>A* Pathfinder is a visualizer of several heuristic functions applied to the A* search family for randomly
    generated or user designed terrain inspired by maps found in the Civilization games. Users are able to select
    which search algorithm to implement, which heuristic to apply, how much weight to apply to that heuristic, and
    compare the time/space complexity of results with each algorithm.
