      <h3><b>Student, Coder, Fencer</b></h3>
      <p>Hi! My name is Andrew. I'm a student at Rutgers University, studying Mathematics, Computer Science, and Music.</p>
      <p>Outside of school, I'm also a fencer. I've fenced for both my high school team and the Rutgers club team, competing in the MACFA-A circuit. I've also been a coach and referee for the past few years, coaching primarily pre-k to middle school aged fencers at clubs and on school teams.</p>
