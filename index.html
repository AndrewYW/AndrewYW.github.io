      <p>Hi! My name is Andrew. I'm a student at Rutgers University, studying Mathematics, Computer Science, and Music. While I entered college thinking I wanted to do something in the medical field or physics,
      I've come to find my passion in software development. Most of my coursework has been in Java, and I've been exposed to and worked on a variety of modern software development principles and technologies,
     such as UML diagramming, MVC design, event-driven GUI programming, and Android app development. I also have some background in database application, particularly in SQL, using it and Python
      to deploy a database web application.</p>
      <p>Outside of school, I'm also a fencer. I've fenced épée for both my high school team and the Rutgers club team, competing in the MACFA-A circuit. I've also been a coach and referee for the past few years,
        coaching primarily pre-k to middle school aged fencers at clubs and on school teams.</p>
