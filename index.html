      <h3>Hello</h3>
      <p>My name is Andrew Wang. I'm a full stack developer located in NYC, with experience in Ruby on Rails, React, and SQL.</p>
      <p>I've worked with a variety of technologies through hobby projects and undergraduate courses at Rutgers University, where I am 
        majoring in Mathematics, with minors in Computer Science and Music.</p>
      <p>Outside of software development, I've been a fencer, coach, and former competitive esport player and coach. I'm also overly fond of
        shoes and mechanical keyboards.</p>
